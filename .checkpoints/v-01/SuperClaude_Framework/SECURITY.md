## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in SuperClaude Framework, please help us address it responsibly.

### Responsible Disclosure

**Please do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, email us directly at: `security@superclaude.dev` (or create a private GitHub Security Advisory)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- **Description** of the vulnerability and potential impact
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue with minimal examples
- **Affected versions** and components
- **Suggested fixes** if you have any ideas
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Severity assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity (see below)
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

## üö® Severity Levels

### Critical (Fix within 24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation that affects system security
- Data exfiltration or unauthorized access to sensitive information

### High (Fix within 1 week)  
- Local code execution through hook manipulation
- Unauthorized file system access beyond intended scope
- Authentication bypass in MCP server communication

### Medium (Fix within 1 month)
- Information disclosure of non-sensitive data
- Denial of service through resource exhaustion
- Input validation issues with limited impact

### Low (Fix in next release)
- Minor information leaks
- Configuration issues with security implications
- Dependency vulnerabilities with low exploitability

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Hook Execution Security
- **Timeout protection**: All hooks have configurable timeouts
- **Input validation**: JSON schema validation for all hook inputs
- **Sandboxed execution**: Hooks run with limited system permissions
- **Error containment**: Hook failures don't affect framework stability

### File System Protection
- **Path validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Permission checking**: Validates file system permissions before operations
- **Secure defaults**: Conservative file access patterns
- **Backup mechanisms**: Safe fallback when operations fail

### MCP Server Security
- **Server validation**: Verify MCP server authenticity and integrity
- **Communication encryption**: Secure channels for all MCP communication
- **Timeout handling**: Prevent resource exhaustion from unresponsive servers
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when servers are compromised

### Configuration Security
- **Input sanitization**: All configuration inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secrets management**: Secure handling of API keys and sensitive data
- **Permission controls**: Fine-grained access controls in settings.json
- **Audit logging**: Track security-relevant configuration changes

## üîß Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security
```bash
# Verify installation scripts before running
cat install.sh | less

# Use development mode for testing
./install.sh --dev

# Check file permissions after installation
ls -la ~/.claude/
```

#### Configuration Security
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm:-rf /*)",
      "Bash(sudo:*)",
      "WebFetch(domain:localhost)"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Regular Maintenance
- **Update regularly**: Keep SuperClaude and dependencies current
- **Review logs**: Check `~/.claude/` for suspicious activity
- **Monitor permissions**: Ensure hooks have minimal required permissions
- **Validate configurations**: Use provided schemas to validate settings

### For Developers

#### Hook Development
```python
# Always validate inputs
def validate_input(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    required_fields = ["tool", "data"]
    return all(field in data for field in required_fields)

# Handle errors gracefully
try:
    result = process_data(input_data)
except Exception as e:
    return {"status": "error", "message": "Processing failed"}

# Use timeouts for external calls
import signal
signal.alarm(10)  # 10-second timeout
```

#### Secure Coding Guidelines
- **Input validation**: Validate all external inputs
- **Error handling**: Never expose internal state in error messages
- **Resource limits**: Implement timeouts and resource limits
- **Principle of least privilege**: Request minimal required permissions

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Release
- [ ] All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] Static security analysis run (bandit, safety)
- [ ] Input validation tests pass
- [ ] Permission model reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated with security considerations

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Monthly dependency security updates
- [ ] Quarterly security review of codebase
- [ ] Annual third-party security assessment
- [ ] Continuous monitoring of security advisories

## ü§ù Security Community

### Bug Bounty Program
Currently, we don't have a formal bug bounty program, but we recognize security researchers who help improve SuperClaude's security:

- **Public acknowledgment** in release notes and security advisories
- **Early access** to new features and versions
- **Direct communication** with the development team

### Security Advisory Process
1. **Internal assessment** of reported vulnerability
2. **Fix development** with thorough testing
3. **Coordinated disclosure** with security researcher
4. **Public advisory** published after fix release
5. **Post-mortem** to prevent similar issues

## üìû Contact Information

### Security Team
- **Email**: `security@superclaude.dev`
- **PGP Key**: Available on request
- **Response Time**: 48 hours maximum

### General Security Questions
For general security questions (not vulnerabilities):
- Create a GitHub Discussion with the "security" label
- Check existing documentation in this file
- Review the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development security practices
