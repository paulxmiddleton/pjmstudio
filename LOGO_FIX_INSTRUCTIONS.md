# Logo Fixed Position Fix Instructions

## Problem
The PXM logo in the top-right corner scrolls with the page instead of staying fixed in position.

## Immediate Fix Applied
1. Added inline CSS to `home.html` as a temporary fix
2. Enhanced CSS specificity in `home.scss`
3. Added debug indicator to confirm CSS loading

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Test the Debug Page
1. Open `debug-logo.html` in your browser
2. Scroll up and down
3. The red box should stay fixed in the top-right corner
4. If it moves, the issue is browser-related

### Step 2: Check CSS Compilation
1. Run `npm run dev` or `npm run build`
2. Check if SCSS files are being compiled
3. Look for any compilation errors in the console

### Step 3: Verify CSS Loading
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Reload the page
4. Check if `home.css` or compiled CSS files are loading
5. Look for any 404 errors

### Step 4: Check for CSS Conflicts
1. In browser dev tools, inspect the logo element
2. Look at the Computed styles
3. Check if `position: fixed` is being applied
4. Look for any overriding styles

### Step 5: Clear Browser Cache
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Or clear browser cache completely
3. Try in an incognito/private window

### Step 6: Check Build Process
1. Ensure Vite is properly configured for SCSS
2. Check `vite.config.js` for CSS preprocessing
3. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

## Expected Behavior
The logo should:
- Stay fixed in the top-right corner (32px from top and right)
- Not move when scrolling
- Have a z-index of 9999 to stay above other content
- Show a yellow "CSS LOADED" indicator (temporary debug feature)

## Permanent Solution
Once the root cause is identified:
1. Remove the inline styles from `home.html`
2. Remove the debug indicator from `home.scss`
3. Ensure proper build process for SCSS compilation

## Common Causes
- SCSS not being compiled to CSS
- CSS files not loading due to incorrect paths
- Browser cache serving old CSS
- Conflicting CSS from other stylesheets
- Missing Vite SCSS preprocessing configuration
